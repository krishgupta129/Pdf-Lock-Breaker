5. Upload your password-protected PDF file. [Already provided one pdf with password]
6. Enter the number of digits you want the brute force to try (e.g., 8 for 00000000 to 99999999).
7. Click "Start Brute Force".
8. Watch the progress bar and see the current password attempt.
9. Use Pause to pause the attack, Resume to continue, and Stop to cancel and reset.
